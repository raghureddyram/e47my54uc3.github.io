    <p> For this first entry I'd like to go over a few things that I've learned this week about VCS systems, git and Github. Please bear with me while I collect my thoughts... OK here goes:
    <p>

    What is git? Well, git is a version control system used to keep track of changes to a repository. A repository is a set of files. Think of git as a virtual accountant, who's able to keep track of all of your bank accounts, properties, and assets automatically.. only instead of accounts you're asking git to keep track of file changes, and instead of an accountant git acts more like an intelligent filing cabinet. The git tracking system works in such a way that other people can keep copies, work off of, and edit copies of the same information that you have on your local machine without overwriting the work that you already have. If someone makes a change and you want to include something they've changed into whatever work you have, git will make that easy to do. Github is basically a company that created an online user interface that makes it easy to view and store git repositories on the internet. Git is to Github as a checking account is to Chase. You use Github because it makes it easy to store and check out yours and other people's work that has been saved... using git.

    Developing with version control systems makes sense because you never want to be in a position where something you've done gets overwritten accidentally by you or someone else. With a vcs in place, you can pretty easily revert a file or set of files to a previous working copy without edits. You can also use git to merge in work that you want included in your master copy if you or someone else has made edits on a different branch.

    Thats about it for git vs Github and VCS systems. Basically git is an advanced tracking system (Version Control System) that Github has built a company around. Did you know Github was built with ruby on rails as part of the underlying stack? The more you know..
