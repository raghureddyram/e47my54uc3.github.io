  <p class="blog">Over the last few days I've made some significant updates to this site that I'm quite happy with. Previously, I was hosting my website through github's pages which meant the url was based entirely off of my github account. This made it incredibly hard to find me (hence why I thought I'd add a disclaimer commenting on how you've found my site as soon as you enter).<p>

  <p class="blog">I've since moved to my own url reflecting the fact that I've got my own little corner of the internet - to showcase my work and my thought process. I've also made sure to update my about me and latest project page with my first app Reech (available on both iOS and Android). If you have any further suggestions for how else I can improve this site or the browsing experience, please let my know by sending me an email. Thanks!</p>
