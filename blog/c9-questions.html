  <p class="blog">In life, as well as software development, we often find ourselves wondering how to properly get information from the tools around us. For software development in particular, there are a number of wonderful tools out there that we use to gather information - chief of which is Google.<p>

  <p class="blog">Asking the right question with Google truly is an art in and of itself (in fact, many books have been written on how to best leverage Google's search algorithm). For engineers, the ability to perform research is practically a prerequisite to working on a project. In order to ask the right question, though, you need to first determine a number of factors. You need to admit to yourself what you <em>know</em>, and what you <em>know that you don't know</em>. Everything in-between those two extremes is what needs to be answered via extensive research.</p>

  <p class="blog">When starting any research, ask yourself how to approach the problem via pseudocode. Make sure to code without using any code-specific syntax, in terms that a high-school math student should be able to understand. Pseudocode allows us to gather information on where to start when coding a solution. Next, determine where the solution is failing through careful analysis of the error messages provided by the program. Use the error message to search for similar errors online, in order to get a sense of the type of problem you're facing. Once you have those three things: an idea of what you know, an idea of how to attack a challenge, and an idea of the kind of error you're facing, you should be able to form a hypothesis. Use this hypothesis to form a question to be asked on StackOverflow. Make sure to offer up as much information as possible to other developers when asking your question.</p>

  <p class="blog">There are far too many available resources online that make finding solutions very easy for many software languages. As long as you make sure to ask the right questions <em>and</em> demonstrate a willingness to learn you'll be able to solve virtually any problem through patience and research.</p>
