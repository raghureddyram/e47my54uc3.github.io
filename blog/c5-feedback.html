  <p class="blog">DBC's feedback system strikes me as particularly unique in the world of software development. I can't recall the last time I've heard of a company or educational institution sending out anonymous feedback surveys <em>and then</em> asking feedback recipients to rate said feedback in order to generate meta feedback.<p>
  
  <p class="blog"> I generally feel like I give a lot of helpful advice to my fellow peers. I don't really have a problem with giving feedback, and it seems like what I've given has been rated as high as I anticipate. It's the feedback that I receive that seems to keep me up at night. Sometimes people don't like it when I explain methods or concepts to them in such a verbose or detailed manner. I can't really help but try to fill in gaps in knowledge with as much detail as I can - it's a byproduct of having worked in a hedge fund. In that type of enviroment you're dead in the water if you don't pay attention to the details; and your understanding is never "complete" until you can prove it. So, when I explain something, I'm actually more or less explaining it out loud <em>to myself</em> for the first time - which is why it can come off as verbose to the other person. In the future I'll try to choose my words a litte more carefully and only offer up explanations to peers when specifically prompted.

  <p class="blog">Pairing as an experience feels a little bit like a highschool dance. There's always this awkward "should I drive?" "no you drive" dynamic that starts off each session. It seems like we try to subconsciously guage our combined understanding of the coursework before settling on either the driver or navigator role for the entire session, since it's a hassle to find a legitimate switching point during the workflow. For me, it seems like I'm more suited to the navigator role since I tend to both drive and navigate while I'm driving. It's really hard NOT to google something that doesn't make sense when I'm coding. Also, I really like to see how other people approach problems since it gives me new ideas every time.

  <p class="blog">I think the most "difficult" part of the pairing/feedback experience stems from trying to strike that perfect balance between explaining <em>enough</em> and explaining something <em>well enough.</em>
