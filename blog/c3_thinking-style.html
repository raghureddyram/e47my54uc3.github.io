  <p class="title">My Thinking Style</p>

      After doing a bit of research I've come to realize that I may be particularly well suited to learning computer science concepts than I am to learning other, more concrete tasks in life. I fall well within the abstract random and abstract sequential style of thinking, with concrete random tendencies. This means that moreso than ordered, fixed ways of learning I like to experiment in large group settings where I have a chance to analyze other people's methods and incorporate learnings from my observations into my own methods.

      After working through the first three weeks of phase 0, I can safely say that this experience has confirmed a lot of my own suspicions about my learning style. I really enjoy having the opportunity to teach others and crowdsource different points of view in large group settings. In the past I had a problem with working with others on issues because I suppose I was never as sure that they would accept what I'm able to contribute. In DBC, though, I've successfully helped a number of other students understand how to approach ruby problems in different ways.

      I think the only remaining challenge I have is in maintaining my patience with other students who are unwilling to cope with the amount of work it takes to understand a concept. Students who are intent on downplaying the amount of effort I'm trying to put in to help them because I'm another student just don't seem to value my time as much as I feel they should, if I'm trying to help them. This, though, seems to be human nature. I'll let other students pick up the slack when I feel as if my aid is unappreciated.
