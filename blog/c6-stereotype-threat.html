  <p class="blog"> As a DBC student, there's going to be perceived "stereotype threat/boost" that I'm going to have to address soon. I'm going to have to come to terms with stereotypes and recognize them early on if I want to have a chance at overcoming them or avoiding them entirely.</p>
  <p class="blog">The concept of stereotype threat can be defined as "the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs". Stereotype threat is considered dangerous in that it may reduce the performance of people who belong to a negatively stereotyped group. This affects me because, if I were to believe in the silicon valley "brogrammer" stereotype that pervades the perception of the startup ecosystem, I'm probably going to either want to associate myself with the stereotype or run away from it entirely. I probably fit the mold of the stereotypical valley startup employee more-so than most: young, male, single, eager-to-work, either-white-or-asian. On the other hand - I also recognize that I value experience, mentors, and diversity of cultures & backgrounds, as the blending of said ingredients are what make for truly great learning and working environments.</p>
  <p class="blog">
   I don't want to give in to stereotype threat or the belief that I'm best served by working in a place with a specific type of workforce, and the reason for why is pretty simple: There are literally thousands of untapped markets out there and it's myopic to believe that the "brogrammers" know of or know how to address every single one. I personally know of underserved financial needs from former customers who work with 65+ year old retirees carrying iphones. These retirees need a financial solution that they're willing to pay for as long as it works and is easy to use, but that won't exist unless someone actively seeks out and understands the problems they face. The "brogrammer" simply can't or won't be bothered to learn about all of the existing market opportuinities for markets that don't fit within a stereotypical world view. To label myself as a brogrammer would not only be disingenous, it'd be an unnecessarily limiting factor as far as I'm concerned.</p>
