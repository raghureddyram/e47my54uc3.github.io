  <p class="blog">Today I'm going to talk about a few ideas and concepts that have stayed with me since my first job in the financial industry. Today I'm going to talk a little bit about my values and what makes me tick.<p>

  <p class="blog">There are definitely times in my life that I can look back on and say I'm proud of. Some of these are characterized by moments of extrordinary achievement and accomplishment. Mostly, though, I think I value the sensation that all humans crave: the sensation of feeling wanted. In our western society we're often taught that we're only worth as much as other people think of us. I, however, believe that this tends to hide the fact that true happiness comes from within. </p>

  <p class="blog">I want to be able to wake up in the morning, look myself in the mirror, and nod my head in approval at the man I see across from me. The character traits that I want to cultivate all center around this fundamental tenet. Therefore, close relationships, health, honesty, integrity, persistence, independence.. they all stem from my desire to preserve my own self-respect. In this respect, I belive I'm at about a 3 on a scale of 1-5 for the values I want to live up to. I've definitely cleared some hurdels but there's still a long journey ahead of me.</p>

  <p class="blog">The last time someone asked for my opinion on something professionally I was taken aback - not because I'm not used to that sort of thing but because I honestly wasn't expecting it. They asked me how I'm able to maintain my composure when dealing with bankers and other investment analysts. I said that it all relates to how you see yourself. If you're able to sleep comfortably at night then you're likely able to wake up looking forward to new challenges each day. Peace of mind is the bedrock that trumps any other strategy used in a hostile negotiation. Whenever I feel like I'm under threat from another party I like to remind myself that the most important thing that matters is how I see myself in the morning. I could care less if someone else doesn't think I'm up to a task, different, or unworthy - so long as I'm ready and willing to prove them <em>wrong.</em></p>
