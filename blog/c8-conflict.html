  <p class="blog">For as long as I can remember I've been considered a 'quiet' person. I'm introverted by nature, which by definition means I spend a lot of time thinking before I speak. Sometimes I feel like this habit is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing when I'm able to carefully measure my response before addressing something while in a conversation. It's most definitely a curse, though, when it prevents me from saying anything contrary to popular opinion. Today I'm going to talk about how and when I feel conflicted and how I need to address and handle those situations in the future.</p>

  <p class="blog">Usually, when I hear something I don't like, I'll tend to either ignore or brush off statements that I find laughable or that I don't agree with. The times when I feel most conflicted are the times when I'm emotionally not in a position to ignore something that's said - typically by a family member. In these instances I can't help but dwell upon the encounter for far too long. If I don't have the courage to speak up and express how I feel at the right time I will end up bottling whatever emotion I'm feeling until a later date. This entirely avoidable angst is something that I really need to mentally identify when I'm in the moment. I think the best preventative measure I can take is to create an emotional checklist at the end of each day - similar to a daily meditation habit - and reflect on my typical triggers to make sure I'm not building something up that I'm not really aware of.</p>
