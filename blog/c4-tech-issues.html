  <p class="blog">One of the most glaring issues facing the technical community today is the widening gap in demographics across the board. If you take a look at the makeup of some of the most well respected companies out there: Google, Facebook, Amazon - you'll see that less than a quarter of employees in technical roles are actually women. The reasons for such disparity are not readily apparent, for if they were, they'd assuredly be addressed sooner rather than later.</p>

  <p class="blog"> One hypothesis, put forth by Verizon, asserts that women have been systematically encouraged to focus on their appearances rather than their intellect from childhood on. What this concept doesn't take into account is the fact that most university graduates are in fact women - meaning over 50% of higher education graduates in the United States are actually female. Why, then, aren't they interseted in working with tech?</p>

  <p class="blog">Personally, I don't have a good answer. My hypothesis tends to agree with Verizon's in that it's possible that working in tech requires and attracts a certain mindset. Such a mindset certainly requires cultivation from an early age. It's very hard to habituate the thought process of critical thinking at a later stage in life than it is to while young, observing how the world works.</p>

  <p class = "blog">I'd argue that the cause of the issue needs to be addressed, rather than the symptoms. More women will work in technical roles only if they see tech as an environment that truly values them as individuals. If there were a 'tech scouts' organization (similar to the girl scouts or boy scouts) that fosters early technical curiosity that may go a long way in helping address this issue.</p>
