      After watching Shareef’s Fireside chat it occurred to me that there are a lot of similarities between being a DBC student as there are with trying to start your own company. For one, I’m going to end up admitting that “I don’t know” the answer to a ton of the problems that I’m going to run into each day. It almost seems like I’m already familiar with many parts of the journey ahead like having an open mind, embracing difficulty, staying hungry to learn, and trying to make it happen even when it’s difficult.

      The one part that I know I’m going to run into is the “impostor syndrome”. I’ve felt it a little bit before when I tried to learn some programming concepts on my own. When I started to learn some of the nuances of Ruby I found myself using lots of pre-built blocks and methods, but when I tried to look at Javascript I found that I had to rely on for loops and iterators. Seeing that difference made me realize that there’s a whole process of thinking in loops with predefined values that I’m going to be uncomfortable with for a short while. My hope is that I’ll be unfamiliar with enough concepts for long enough that I’ll eventually become familiar. I see DBC as a focused place to channel that “I know nothing” mindset into something real, with a group of people that I’ll be able to relate and empathize with. There’s something magical about shared experience.
