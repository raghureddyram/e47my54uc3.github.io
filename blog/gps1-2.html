  <div class="what">
      <p>What is pair programming?</p>
      <p>Pair programming is a way to program collaboratively. This can be done in person or remotely.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="why">
      <p>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</p>
      <p>It's important because it helps peers learn from each other. In the industry pair programming is common. It also helps us to
      edit and create projects together.</p>

      <p>Driving is the act of writing code and working with the actual platform. The driver is the one who actually types the desired output. The act of driving is the counterpart to the act of navigating.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-right">
      <p>The act of navigating is the counterpart to the act of driving. The navigator guides the process, researches a topic, and helps to spot the errors in the code in real-time.</p>

  <div class="reflection">
      <p>This pair programming was fun but we both thought it would be more suited for in-person rather than a remote project since the set-up time is more than should be expected for an hour pair program session.  Also, stypi was down so we had to change platforms a couple times to figure out a way to make it work, and what the best way it would be for a remote session.</p>
      <p>We both felt more comfortable this time since it is the second week of pairing; however, we both felt that the process is more suited to more algorithmic kinds of challenges as opposed to visual/design ones, e.g.: It took longer to communicate how we wanted something to look especially when it is done remotely.</p>
      <p>We both think we worked well together on the learning competencies.</p>
