  <p class="blog"> This week I got a chance to explore and compare JavaScript and its syntax to the more familiar Ruby syntax that I've been working with. JavaScript has gained popularity as part of the backend tech stack in the last couple of years thanks to the advent of node.js. After playing with it for the last couple weeks I can see some definite benefits as well as severely limiting drawbacks. <p>

  <p class="blog">Part of what makes JS so attractive is its ubiquity as a front-end language that virtually every developer must learn (along with HTML and CSS these days). That being said, there's a reason for why it has developed in the shadows of Java and C++ for all these years. In actuality, JavaScript is really a technology developed by Netscape that used to go by the name of ECMAscript, but for marketing purposes was dubbed 'Java'-script in order to piggy-back off of the success of Java. It shares many features borrowed from C and Java, such as clunky switch statements and for loops that are otherwise not used or ignored alltogether in Ruby.</p>

  <p class="blog">Both Ruby and JavaScript have similar ways of creating and handling indefinite looping mechanisms - through the use of while loops. Where Ruby and JavaScript begin to differ is in their methods for handling defined iteration events. Ruby employs the use of iterators via code blocks, while JavaScript depends on specifically defined for-loops, counter variables, and termination clauses. JavaScript is therefore more difficult to program since the engineer must keep track of all ingredients that are used while composing the for-loop. While this is a bit more cumbersome in most situations, sometimes it proves to be more readable as occasionally a for-loop will make more sense for calculations involving factorials or summations. Using Ruby's preferred reduce or inject notation while passing in a proc argument can often lead to confusion as inject will obfuscate the mechanisms that are actually performing calculations.</p>

  <p class="blog"> For my tastes, I prefer Ruby since the logic is easy to understand once you get used to it, and it's much easier to debug when things aren't working out quite as expected. I also really enjoy object oriented programming with classes and defined structures, something which JavaScript severly lacks.</p>
