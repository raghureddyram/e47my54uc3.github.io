  <p class="blog">Over the last couple weeks I've been working on both Ruby and SQL onsite at the DBC campus. It's been an interesting journey so far. I feel I've really gotten a chance to see just how different DBC's instruction and methodology is from any other educational institution.<p>

  <p class="blog">DBC's Engineering Empathy sessions really stand out as being the most different component of the entire experience. Compared to the University of California schools, DBC places a much greater emphasis on interactions among peers. Rather than the top down, Instructor led educational system, we're actively encouraged to lean on the insights and aid of our peers to find solutions to real-world problems. I was expecting a much greater emphasis on things I've heard are important components of Computer Science -- stuff like memory management, algorithms, etc. Instead I'm being asked to create Sudoku game boards and interactive applications built entirely out of vanilla Ruby.</p>

  <p class="blog">I think what I'm impressed with most is my ability to articulate and communicate which technical problems I'm facing. It's much easier to communicate issues with my peers now than it ever was in the past (when I was working in finance and in college). I'm way more comfortable tapping my peers on the shoulders since that's the entire point of the system... there's virtually little ego involved. No 'ohh I can't believe they're not done with this challenge set' type of commentary on any level.</p>
