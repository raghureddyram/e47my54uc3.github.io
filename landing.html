              <p class="blog">One of the most glaring issues facing the technical community today is the widening gap in demographics across the board. If you take a look at the makeup of some of the most well respected companies out there: Google, Facebook, Amazon - you'll see that less than a quarter of employees in technical roles are actually women. The reasons for such disparity are not readily apparent, for if they were, they'd assuredly be addressed sooner rather than later. One hypothesis, put forth by Verizon, asserts that women have been systematically encouraged to focus on their appearances rather than their intellect from childhood on. What this concept doesn't take into account is the fact that most university graduates are in fact women - meaning over 50% of higher education graduates in the United States are actually female. Why, then, aren't they interseted in working with tech?</p>

                <p class="blog">The Enumerable module is one of the most powerful modules available to ruby.<p>

                <p class="blog">Many of the major ruby classes, including Array and Hash, mix in the enumerable module by default in order to make working with collections of objects much easier. Enumerable works by essentially defining a list of objects, and then setting an instruction for <em>each</em> item in said list. For this reason, in order to make an enumerable class of your own, you'll need to define a method.</p>
                 <blockquote class="blog" style="color:black">Object.each { yield }</blockquote> 
                 <p class="blog">The above will instruct what you want to do with each element in your collection upon iteration. </p>

                <p class="blog">After doing a bit of research I've come to realize that I may be particularly well suited to learning computer science concepts than I am to learning other, more concrete tasks in life. I fall well within the abstract random and abstract sequential style of thinking, with concrete random tendencies. This means that moreso than ordered, fixed ways of learning I like to experiment in large group settings where I have a chance to analyze other people's methods and incorporate learnings from my observations into my own methods.

                    CSS is the language that does most of the heavy lifting in terms of creating a great User Experience on the web. While HTML is the language used to identify and thematically group specific ideas and elements on web page, CSS is what is used to identify the color scheme, spacing, and even some of the actions that occur on a website while a user's mouse hovers over a specified area. <br><br>

            <section>
              <p class="blog">
                After watching Shareef’s Fireside chat it occurred to me that there are a lot of similarities between being a DBC student as there are with trying to start your own company. For one, I’m going to end up admitting that “I don’t know” the answer to a ton of the problems that I’m going to run into each day. It almost seems like I’m already familiar with many parts of the journey ahead like having an open mind, embracing difficulty, staying hungry to learn, and trying to make it happen even when it’s difficult. 
              </p>
              <p class="blog">
                The one part that I know I’m going to run into is the “impostor syndrome”. I’ve felt it a little bit before when I tried to learn some programming concepts on my own. When I started to learn some of the nuances of Ruby I found myself using lots of pre-built blocks and methods, but when I tried to look at Javascript I found that I had to rely on for loops and iterators. Seeing that difference made me realize that there’s a whole process of thinking in loops with predefined values that I’m going to be uncomfortable with for a short while. My hope is that I’ll be unfamiliar with enough concepts for long enough that I’ll eventually become familiar. I see DBC as a focused place to channel that “I know nothing” mindset into something real, with a group of people that I’ll be able to relate and empathize with. There’s something magical about shared experience.

            <p class="subtitle">about Git?</p>
            <p class="date">2/5/2015</p>

            <section>
              <p class="blog"> For this first entry I'd like to go over a few things that I've learned this week about VCS systems, git and Github. Please bear with me while I collect my thoughts... OK here goes:
              </p>
              <p class="blog">
              What is git? Well, git is a version control system used to keep track of changes to a repository. A repository is a set of files. Think of git as a virtual accountant, who's able to keep track of all of your bank accounts, properties, and assets automatically.. only instead of accounts you're asking git to keep track of file changes, and instead of an accountant git acts more like an intelligent filing cabinet. The git tracking system works in such a way that other people can keep copies, work off of, and edit copies of the same information that you have on your local machine without overwriting the work that you already have. If someone makes a change and you want to include something they've changed into whatever work you have, git will make that easy to do. Github is basically a company that created an online user interface that makes it easy to view and store git repositories on the internet. Git is to Github as a checking account is to Chase. You use Github because it makes it easy to store and check out yours and other people's work that has been saved... using git.
             </p>
             <section>
              <p class="blog">
              Developing with version control systems makes sense because you never want to be in a position where something you've done gets overwritten accidentally by you or someone else. With a vcs in place, you can pretty easily revert a file or set of files to a previous working copy without edits. You can also use git to merge in work that you want included in your master copy if you or someone else has made edits on a different branch.
              </p>
              <p class="blog">
              Thats about it for git vs Github and VCS systems. Basically git is an advanced tracking system (Version Control System) that Github has built a company around. Did you know Github was built with ruby on rails as part of the underlying stack? The more you know..
